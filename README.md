## Abstract

This paper contends that traditional academic peer review is a colonial epistemic structure that entrenches injustice and exclusion rather than ensuring quality. Drawing on Joseph Raz’s critique of irrational delegation, Martin Heidegger’s analysis of technological enframing, Henry Giroux’s pedagogy of critical resistance, and Raewyn Connell’s sociology of global academic monocultures, I show how peer review perpetuates testimonial and hermeneutical injustices, marginalising multimodal, interdisciplinary, Indigenous, diasporic, and cognitively diverse scholarship.

A comparative analysis of the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Germany, and the United States reveals that statutory and constitutional safeguards rarely translate into proactive fiduciary practice. Institutional reliance on peer review instead reinforces Eurocentric epistemic hierarchies and systematically undermines scholarly autonomy.

In response, I propose an epistemocratic governance model that embeds fiduciary transparency, distributed epistemic agency, multimodal and cognitive pluralism, and responsible AI integration. This framework dismantles colonial gatekeeping and reorients institutions toward epistemic justice and democratic accountability.

The paper concludes that colonial peer review must be rejected outright. Only epistemocratic renewal can secure authentic pluralism, integrity, and accountability in contemporary academia.
