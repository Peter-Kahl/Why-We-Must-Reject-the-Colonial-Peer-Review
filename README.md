### Abstract

In this paper, I critically examine traditional academic peer review systems as mechanisms perpetuating colonial epistemic structures. Drawing explicitly on fiduciary-epistemic theory, democratic epistemology (Anderson 2006), and my comparative analysis of constitutional and statutory governance frameworks across Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, I argue that universities and institutional epistemic gatekeepers have clear moral, epistemic, and fiduciary obligations to proactively address testimonial and hermeneutical injustices. Traditional peer review processes, as I demonstrate, systematically marginalise multimodal, interdisciplinary, indigenous, and cognitively diverse scholarship, thus reinforcing epistemic homogenisation and structural epistemic injustice.

Through recent institutional controversies—such as the cases involving Kathleen Stock at Sussex, Arif Ahmed at Cambridge, the Sullivan Review, governance failures at the Oxford Union, and recent fiduciary governance gaps at Harvard—I highlight critical practical vulnerabilities and fiduciary accountability challenges within contemporary institutional structures. These examples underscore the urgency for explicit fiduciary reforms in peer review. Furthermore, I argue that the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents urgent ethical and practical challenges inadequately addressed by existing peer review governance models.

In response, I propose a comprehensive epistemocratic governance model, explicitly integrating fiduciary transparency, distributed epistemic agency, multimodal epistemic inclusivity, and responsible AI oversight. Grounded in comparative legal analyses, institutional case studies, and my own scholarly framework of fiduciary epistemic duties, I urgently advocate fiduciary-informed institutional reforms as essential to achieving epistemic justice, scholarly autonomy, democratic epistemic inclusivity, and genuine epistemic openness within contemporary academia.
